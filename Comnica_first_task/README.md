# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Run the following command to install all the necessary node modules:

```js
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, use the following command:

```js
npm run dev
```

This will launch the Vite development server, and you can view the application in the browser.
